# GAN-Induration-image-generation-

GAN used to increase the size of a very limited dataset containing 150 images of the same class. Tested on Melanoma Images, Induration Images. 

To run the code:

- Open up the Colab notebook
- Run each cell individually
- If you would like to save the changes you make, save a copy in your own google drive (you will see an option for this in Colab)
